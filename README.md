# FileSystem
I have considered a scenario where I have a hierarchical data structure representing a file system. Each file or folder has a unique identifier, a name, a parent ID to denote its containing folder, and a size in bytes. The goal is to get a result set showing the total size of each folder and its subfolders in the file system.
